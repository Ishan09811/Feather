# 🪶 Feather Browser

Feather Browser is an experimental, lightweight desktop web browser focused on performance, low memory usage, and native integration.
It is built using Kotlin, JCEF (Java Chromium Embedded Framework), and Swing Desktop.

Feather Browser is currently in active development and not intended for daily browsing yet.

### Build and Run Desktop (JVM) Application

To build and run the development version of the desktop app, use the run configuration from the run widget
in your IDE’s toolbar or run it directly from the terminal:

  ```shell
  ./gradlew :composeApp:run
  ```
- on Windows
  ```shell
  .\gradlew.bat :composeApp:run
  ```
